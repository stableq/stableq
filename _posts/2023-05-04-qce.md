### Overview

We are currently living in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where noise and scalability are well-known and crucial issues. We have been witnessing the rapid development of superconducting quantum computers, which gradually alleviates scalability issues where we have quantum computer with 433 qubits from IBM. However, the high noise in quantum computing is still a barrier to the use of quantum computing in real-world applications. Although they have great potential to work well on a fixed noise level, the change of noise will make the pre-designed noise-aware solution useless and incur high overhead for solution adaptation. Unfortunately, the noises on quantum devices are unstable. This workshop is proposed to develop an open platform to present the unstable issue to the quantum computing research community, report the state-of-the-art development efforts, exchange ideas and practices, and foster research collaboration to develop novel techniques to address the unstable noise issue and provide a reproducible quantum computing system.

<!-- Introduction -->
**We invite submissions to the Quantum System Stability and Reproducibility Workshop (StableQ)**, which is held at the IEEE Quantum Week conference. The workshop will provide a platform for researchers and industry experts to present and discuss the latest advances in mitigating unstable noise in quantum computing.

<!-- objective -->
The objective of the proposed workshop on the unstable noise of quantum computing is to address one of the most significant challenges in the development of quantum computing, which is the issue of unstable noise. The workshop aims to bring together experts and researchers from different backgrounds to explore and share their insights on this critical problem. The objective is to provide a platform to discuss different approaches to mitigating noise, including error-correction techniques, noise-reducing algorithms, and hardware improvements.

<!--The detailed objectives are listed as follows:
* Develop a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research on unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Provide a platform for researchers and industry experts to present and discuss their latest findings and insights on mitigating unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Foster collaboration among researchers and industry experts to develop novel techniques and strategies for addressing unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Facilitate discussions on the limitations of current techniques and identify areas where further research is needed.
* Encourage the development of reproducible quantum computing systems that can effectively mitigate unstable noise.
* Provide an opportunity for attendees to network and build new collaborations in the field of quantum computing.

Bio:
Alex K. Jones is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science (by courtesy) at the University of Pittsburgh.  He is currently on leave from Pitt to serve as a Program Director in the CNS Division of CISE at the US NSF.  Dr. Jones’ research interests are broadly in the area of computer architecture.  He is currently investigating quantum system codesign including design of basis gates, topologies, and transpilation from resonator devices to systems.  He is also well known for advancing the field of sustainable computing and is also actively developing nanoscale magnetic memory systems including spin-transfer-torque and Racetrack memories with an emphasis on processing in memory.  His other interests include reliability and fault-tolerance, computing and memories in harsh environments such as space,  and compilation techniques for configurable systems and architectures, among others.  He has more than 200 publications in these areas.  His research is funded by NSF, DARPA, NSA, ARO, and industry.

Abstract:
Superconducting quantum computing has pushed scaling to enable systems with dozens or even hundreds of qubits.  Unfortunately, these machines remain limited in the size of quantum circuits that can be realized due to significant sources of noise.  In this talk, I will discuss the collaborative-design between quantum computer architectures, physical devices, and transpilation flows to improve circuit fidelity without dramatic changes to the underlying physical hardware.  I will focus on three recent advancements from our group towards achieving better co-design.  First, I demonstrate the advantage of modulator design to both optimize system basis gates as well as qubit interconnection topologies.  Second, I show how it is possible to enhance the capability of the selected basis gate by driving both the modulator and the qubits in parallel.  Third, I discuss a method called MIRAGE that leverages mirror gates to further enhance the capability of the basis gate while further improving routing flexibility of the system through a cross-layer transpilation approach.  I will present the value of these approaches for a real superconducting system that uses SNAIL modulators and transmon qubits, as well as discuss some implications for commercial systems from IBM and Google.  Finally, I will discuss some further directions my team is exploring in co-design in modulator quantum computer design as part of ModQ.
